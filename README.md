# `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/apache-tomcat`
The Paketo Apache Tomcat Buildpack is a Cloud Native Buildpack that contributes Apache Tomcat and Process Types for WARs.

## Behavior
This buildpack will participate all the following conditions are met

* `<APPLICATION_ROOT>/WEB-INF` exists
* `Main-Class` is NOT defined in the mainfest

The buildpack will do the following:

* Requests that a JRE be installed
* Contribute a Tomcat instance to `$CATALINA_HOME`
* Contribute a Tomcat instance to `$CATALINA_BASE`
  * Contribute `context.xml`, `logging.properties`, `server.xml`, and `web.xml` to `conf/`
  * Contribute [Access Logging Support][als], [Lifecycle Support][lcs], and [Logging Support][lgs]
  * Contribute external configuration if available
* Contributes `tomcat`, `task`, and `web` process types

### Tiny Stack

When this buildpack runs on the [Tiny stack](https://paketo.io/docs/concepts/stacks/#tiny), which has no shell, the following notes apply:
* As there is no shell, the `catalina.sh` script cannot be used to start Tomcat
* The Tomcat Buildpack will generate a start command directly. It does not support all the functionality in `catalina.sh`.
* Some configuration options such as `bin/setenv.sh` and setting `CATALINA_*` environment variables, will not be available.
* Tomcat will be run with `umask` set to `0022` instead of the `catalina.sh`provided default of `0027`

## Configuration
| Environment Variable | Description
| -------------------- | -----------
| `$BP_TOMCAT_CONTEXT_PATH` | The context path to mount the application at.  Defaults to empty (`ROOT`).
| `$BP_TOMCAT_EXT_CONF_SHA256` | The SHA256 hash of the external configuration package
| `$BP_TOMCAT_EXT_CONF_STRIP` | The number of directory levels to strip from the external configuration package.  Defaults to `0`.
| `$BP_TOMCAT_EXT_CONF_URI` | The download URI of the external configuration package
| `$BP_TOMCAT_EXT_CONF_VERSION` | The version of the external configuration package
| `$BP_TOMCAT_VERSION` |  Configure a specific Tomcat version.  This value must _exactly_ match a version available in the buildpack so typically it would configured to a wildcard such as `9.*`.
| `BPL_TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOGGING_ENABLED` | Whether access logging should be activated.  Defaults to inactive.

### External Configuration Package
The artifacts that the repository provides must be in TAR format and must follow the Tomcat archive structure:

```
<CATALINA_BASE>
└── conf
    ├── context.xml
    ├── server.xml
    ├── web.xml
    ├── ...
```

## Bindings
The buildpack optionally accepts the following bindings:

### Type: `dependency-mapping`
|Key                   | Value   | Description
|----------------------|---------|------------
|`<dependency-digest>` | `<uri>` | If needed, the buildpack will fetch the dependency with digest `<dependency-digest>` from `<uri>`
